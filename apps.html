  <h1>Matt's Apps</h1>
  
    <p>This page will showcase apps that I create in CSC 106. There are many apps in use today. Every single day 
      when someone uses their phone they are using an application to accomplish the task they want to accomplish. 
      Some apps are for gaming, some are for fitness, some are for utilities and there are many other categories of
      apps.
